# Sorgra
ELPath's sorting features, improved and adapted for the web.
Sorgra improves upon concepts and systems implemented in its predecessor project, [ELPath](https://github.com/ChrisOh431/ELPath). The main difference in this case being that Sorgra will be more polished, and built as a website rather than a Python application.

Assembled lovingly with TypeScript, React, [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) and [react-chartjs-2.](https://github.com/reactchartjs/react-chartjs-2)
