# Sorgra
ELPath, adapted for the web.
Sorgra improves upon concepts and systems implemented in its predecessor project, [ELPath](https://github.com/ChrisOh431/ELPath). The main difference in this case being that Sorgra will be more polished, and built as a website rather than a Python application.

Assembled lovingly with TypeScript, React, and D3.JS (so far!)
