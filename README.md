Sorgra improves upon concepts and systems implemented in its predecessor project, [ELPath](https://github.com/ChrisOh431/ELPath). The main difference between the two is platform, as well as features. While Sorgra lacks pathfinding alg support, it does have more robust, user-friendly, and detailed sorting algorithms, with vastly improved demonstrations of Merge, Selection and Quick Sort compared to ELPath. Even beyond that, Sorgra boasts more colors and greater consistency by which they're used, step descriptions that've been iterated upon extensively to optimize understandability, and a design suited for both mobile and desktop web usage. What's not to love?
